Phoenix Live View makes it possible to build real time web applications without writing any javascript.

All the rendering is done on the server, so the pages can display quickly and the user can view the content even if they have javascript is disabled.

As a proof of concept I'm working on a chat application that uses Live View that still functions when javascript is disabled!
